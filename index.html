    <h6>ABOUT</h6>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p> <font size="5"><b>Summary of the page</b></font><br><br>The stream is a jolly good podcast talk with friends. <br>In the stream, a group of  friends (Sean, Faythe, and Khim) are with some members of the Visionaries (Kenneth and Shiloh) <br> to share past experiences and stories with both the viewers and each other!<br>
        <br> In the stream titled, Tropa Time Talk with The MAIRS! ft. Kenneth and Shiloh from the Visionaries, <br> the streamers with the special guests from the Visionaries (Kenneth and Shiloh) firstly introduced themselves to the viewers. <br> And after the short introduction, they shared stories and experiences, and talked about the field trip <br> that they have participated in, the fun week regarding the sport that they are going to participate in and the name of the team colors, <br> the streamers also talked about the get-together in the SM after the year end party.  <br> <br> Additionally the streamers were also interacting and shouting out the viewers to add more connection to the streamer with the viewer.
        <br> Overall, the summary of the stream was the streamers having a casual conversation about their shared past experiences and stories with <br> both the viewers and each other, and interacting with the viewers during the stream.
        <br><br><font size="5"><b>Positive Things from the Stream</b></font><br><br>The streamers tried to set a casual atmosphere for the stream and it was well done due to the familiarity between the streamers. 
        <br>The low effort look of the stream also helped set the casual atmosphere, as the watchers would be able to recognize that the stream was not being done by <br> seasoned professional streamers. 
        Other guests being brought into the stream solidified the atmosphere of the stream to just be casual talk. <br>Another reason for the atmosphere of the stream being well done is the unscripted nature of their conversations, they were able to set a very natural progression <br>  in the stream that was not stopped by any awkwardness as if they were friends just casually talking to one another unrecorded. <br> The progression of the stream was seamless and the stream was able to progress in its discussions naturally due to the streamers ability to converse with each other.<br>

        <br>Apart from the ones mentioned before, another thing well done  by the streamers were the wide variety of topics they were able to discuss in their stream. <br> Due to the familiarity of the streamers with each other, they were able to find various topics to discuss in the duration of the stream. <br> The stream was kept interesting by the different engaging stories and rants by the streamers and their guests. <br> The realism in the emotions of the streamers was another thing that was well done in the stream. <br>All of the streamers and their guests were able to express realistic emotions during the stream as they were not restricted by a main topic <br>where they should keep professional, <br>as there was no main topic and the streamers were able to talk about anything they wanted without the general vibe of the stream being destroyed.
        <br><br><font size="5"><b>Opportunities in the Stream</b></font><br><br> The section of the broadcast when we discussed their school and outside of their school experiences is an example of a good opportunity because <br>it helps connect and be relatable with the audience while allowing them to add more to the conversation. One thing to add is when the streamer is interacting and shouting <br> out the audience is also another good opportunity because they're connecting with the audience and it helps the audience feel known and  feel like they are connected <br>with the conversation of the stream. Additionally, the audience could add more to the discussions hence branching out the discussion and helping with<br> the viewership engagement.<br>

        <br> With the opportunities found during the stream, there were also missed opportunities. <br> One of them is that the streamers should have added more streaming materials to the stream, such as background music, overlays, layouts, and presentations. <br> Another missed opportunity is that while having conversations and interactions with both the viewers and with each other, <br> the streamers should have played games (such as IceBreakers and online games) with the viewers to increase engagement and viewership levels.
        <br><br><font size="5"><b>Viewer Engagement</b></font><br><br> How does the engagement of the audience affect the overall performance of the stream? <br>The performance of the stream all depends on the viewer and to boost its performance is by interacting with the viewer and <br>by interacting with the viewer it helps the stream perform better by connecting with the audience and being relatable with the viewer it helps <br>build a connection with the audience and the audience could add more to the conversation hence boosting the performance of the stream. <br>

        <br>During our stream, it was relatively healthy with streamers interacting with the viewer and shouting them out.<br> It helps keep the performance of the stream relevant and fresh with the streamers connecting with the audience. <br> Overall the engagement of our viewer is relatively healthy based on our forms, during the stream, and YouTube analytics.
        <br><br><font size="5"><b>Viewership</b></font><br><br> The stream has received a total of 105 views, with the stream gaining 14 views in its duration. After the stream, <br>it has received 91 views, the reason for the high viewership of  the stream is that it has been recommended by the algorithm to a lot of viewers. <br>The algorithm has favored the stream to be recommended to large amounts of potential viewers, <br> enough so that it managed to get the attention of nearly a hundred viewers. <br> Another reason for the large amounts of views in the stream is the prior promotion done by the ones who would be streaming, <br> this allowed for more awareness for the stream and more audience that would watch the stream as a result.
        <br>
        <br>Their different methods of advertising their stream prior to going live allowed for more views in the stream. <br> The views during their stream peaked around 14 views.
